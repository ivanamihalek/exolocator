\hypertarget{index_Purpose}{}\section{Purpose}\label{index_Purpose}
exolocator pipeline is intended to fill exolocator\-\_\-db, the database behind the Exo\-Locator server.  Exo\-Locator server, in turn, is aimed at being a one-\/stop shopping point for comparative  analysis of protein sequences.  \hypertarget{index_Design}{}\section{Design}\label{index_Design}
The main aim in desinging the pipeline has been intuitive use and reproducibility\-:  by using the scripts in the order in which they are enumerated, the user should be able to  recreate and/or update exolocator\-\_\-db.  \hypertarget{index_Databases}{}\section{Databases}\label{index_Databases}
exolocator pipeline functions by manipulating databases\-: everything except full genomic sequences is  is stored in a database, from the configuration of the pipeline itself, to core anntotation data for each species  from Ensembl, and taxonomy information info from N\-C\-B\-I.
