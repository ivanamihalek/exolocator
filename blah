Hello Olaf and Martin.

Here is my final version.

Martin, please note that you cannot blame the M90I for the binding pocket modification, it is too far away.
The mechanism is *not*  comparable to that of Q79L.

Alos would you please use my original alignment illustration (attached). The one that I see as table 1 is not only rather ugly, it also misses the point that the positions that you are looking at are conserved across both flavors of Rit protein, underlining that they might be of structural importance. (Also ENSEMBL is a database not a program to asses protein conservation).

In any case, nice to see this one wrapped up,

MY best to both,

Ivana
